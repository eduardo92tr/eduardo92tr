Hi! 👋, I'm Eduardo Martínez Ramírez
About me
Graduate in TAFAD, reoriented towards my passion for technology 💻. Graduated as a Higher Technician in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM), and specializing as a web developer for Microsoft Azure. I'm also specializing in Java, C#, .NET, PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sprting Boot.
My goal is to become a great full-stack developer, and that's why I'm researching and trying to improve every day. 💪💪

I currently live in Spain, but I've always loved traveling and experiencing new adventures. Learning about other cultures, and who knows, if the opportunity arises, I would be open to living in another place. Although Spain will always be my home. 😊

🕵🏼‍♂️👨🏼‍💻 I worked for years at various sports centers and then in infrastructure protection services at EULEN. However, I decided to change my life and fulfill the dream of exploring new technologies from within. That's why I prefer to develop, bring them to life, and create beautiful projects.

I love reading, history (I'm a good tour guide, 😜), movies, sports🏃🏼‍♂️, and videogames.

👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at https://portafoliojorgesm.netlify.app

💬 Ask me about HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Java, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Python, MySQL.

⚡ Fun fact I am a determined computer scientist, a person always willing to learn and overcome new challenges, who enjoys sports, nature, traveling, making friends, and "The Lord of the Rings"... A curious mix, 😂.
